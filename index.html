                    <h2>The Vintage Restaurant at Stone Hill Winery</h2>

                    <p>On a Sunday afternoon, I found myself at the Stone Hill Winery to enjoy some wine and food. The Vintage Restaurant,
                        which once was a carriage house and horse barn, is right by the main building. I ended up getting the German Trio. 
                        The dish serves up schweineschnitzel with your choice of sauce, house-marinated beef sauerbraten with a spicy Hermannsberger
                        wine sauce, and a locally produced wurst. Overall the meal was too salty for my liking. I would recommend this to 
                        someone who loves really salty food.</p>

                    <p>I got to enjoy this delicious meal on my birthday this year. I had the Shrimp and Grits with a cup of Chicken and Andouille Gumbo
                        on the side. This place has one of the best gumbos I have tried. Also, I love the atmosphere with the live music.</p>

                    <h2>The Cheesecake Factory</h2>
                    <img src = "/Users/sarahyi/Desktop/LaunchCode/html-me-something/Images/cheesecake-factory.jpg" alt = "Chicken piccata dish.">
                    <p>Sometimes you end up having more than one meal to celebrate your birthday. This year, I was fortunate enough to enjoy just that.
                        One of the places I got to go to was The Cheesecake Factory. They have so many options to choose from so it took me awhile to 
                        pick something out. I ended up trying the Chicken Piccata. It's saut√©ed chicken breast with lemon sauce, mushrooms, and capers, 
                        which is served with angel hair pasta. The meal was so good. I recommend this dish if you like the taste of lemon.</p>
